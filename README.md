# Python Learning Repository

## Overview

The **Python Learning** repository contains scripts that were created during my journey of learning Python. It encompasses a variety of essential topics, including loops, dictionaries, lists, strings, object-oriented programming (OOP), classes, and more. This repository serves as a practical resource for applying and reinforcing the concepts learned throughout my studies. Each script offers hands-on experience with Python's syntax and features, facilitating a deeper understanding of programming in Python.

## Key Features

- **Diverse Topics**: This repository encompasses a wide range of Python topics, including:
  - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Scripts in the `Classes_OOP` folder demonstrate OOP concepts.
  - **Data Structures**: Explore modules and collections like `namedtuple`, `deque`, and more in the `Collection` files.
  - **Regular Expressions (RegEx)**: Learn and practice regex through various examples in the `RegEx` folder.
  - **Functional Programming**: Includes exercises on higher-order functions, generators, and lambda functions in `video_20_lambda.py`, `video_22_yield_generatory.py`, and others.
  - **Recursion and Loops**: Deep dives into recursion techniques and nested loops are found in `recursion.py` and `nested loops.py`.
  - **File Operations**: Understand file handling with examples in `video_14_operacjeNaPlikach.py`.

- **Hands-on Practice**: Each script is an opportunity to experiment with Python's syntax and features. Users are encouraged to run, modify, and expand upon the provided code to deepen their learning.

- **Video Tutorials**: The repository includes code from various video tutorials (e.g., `video_11_math.py`, `video_12_try_except.py`), which offer practical examples of Python concepts.
